# MSN Messenger Emotifier

I was messing around back in like 2005 with ASCII text generators like [this one](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/asciitext.shtml) when I thought Iâ€™d combine that with the power of MSN Messenger. But how to address the font kerning issue? ASCII text art needs a fixed-width font.

The solution? Draw in emoticons! The Emotifier was thus born.
